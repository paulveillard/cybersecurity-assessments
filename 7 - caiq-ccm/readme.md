# Cloud Control Matrix (CCM): 4.0

- The CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing.
  - It is composed of 197 control objectives that are structured in 17 domains covering all key aspects of cloud technology.
 
> It can be used as a tool for the systematic assessment of a cloud implementation, and provides guidance on which security controls should be implemented by which actor within the cloud supply chain. The controls framework is aligned to the CSA Security Guidance for Cloud Computing, and is considered a de-facto standard for cloud security assurance and compliance.

## What is the Cloud Controls Matrix?
The CCM provides cloud service providers with best practices for the secure implementation of cloud infrastructure and services. It also helps cloud service customers assess the security of cloud service providers.

CCM version 4 evaluates cloud providers based on the following criteria:

- Audit & Assurance
- Application & Interface Security
- Business Continuity Management & Operational
- Change Control & Configuration Management
- Cryptography, Encryption, & Key Management
- Datacenter Security
- Data Security & Privacy Lifecycle Management
- Governance, Risk, & Compliance
- Human Resources
- Identity & Access Management
- Interoperability & Portability
- Infrastructure & Virtualization Security
- Logging & Monitoring
- Security Incident Management, E-discovery, & Cloud Forensics
- Supply Chain Management, Transparency, & Accountability
- Threat & Vulnerability Management
- Universal Endpoint Management

## Why do we need Cloud Controls Matrix?
The CCM considers some of the most important and well-known regulations and standards, such as those from NIST, ISO, and PCI. The framework provides recommendations about what must be done to minimize risks associated with cloud computing. The CCM is therefore useful for defining, implementing, and fulfilling security requirements, and can also be used to monitor the implementation of those security requirements.

## How your organization can apply the Cloud Controls Matrix
Organizations can use the CCM to define and identify policies and technical requirements. Using these defined policies and requirements, they can control goals and objectives that will be included in their security program. With clear objectives, organizations can then enforce specific directives related to users and employees, other organizations, and cloud service providers, and can better comply with external regulations.
